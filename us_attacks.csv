Essex shot and killed both managers in two separate incidents.  Essex then lit more hotel rooms on fire.  At this point, Essex began shooting at the policemen and firemen that approached the hotel.  He shot and killed Deputy Super Intendent Louis Sirgo, Patrolman Pail Persigo and Patrolman Philip J. Coleman Sr.  Twenty  others were wounded as well.  Finally, the police were able to force Essex to the roof of the building.

This incident is linked to the firebombing, about a week later,  of a shop in Chicago, owned by an American of Croatian descent (197810040004) as well as the murder of another American of Croatian descent, Krizan Brkic, in California, who has also received a similar threatening letter (197811220002). In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).

Around 11am, the perpetrators called the Embassy Theater warning of a second bomb (although no bomb was present), hoping the police would take the threat seriously due to the bomb from the day before.  An hour later, around 12pm, about three hours prior to the robbery, the perpetrators unloaded several boxes of roofing nails into a highway tunnel, hoping to cause a traffic jam due to flat tires, and further divert police.  However, the traffic jam failed, and traffic proceeded as usual. Around 3:00pm, the robbery took place. All the perpetrators except Mathews and Parmenter were eventually captured, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.  Mathews died in a fire in the midst of a shoot out with police, when he refused to surrender, and Parmenter became a star witness for the prosecution in the Seattle trial, but was sentenced to prison time for his other crimes while in The Order.","Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, ""The Silent Brotherhood: Inside America's Racist Underground,"" The Free Press, Macmillan Inc., 1989.","Mark S.

After the men got away, they stopped at the Palmo Recreational area, where they switched cars, transferred all the money and belongings, and changed their clothes before pulling back onto the highway.  In addition to the twelve perpetrators who committed the robbery, a former Brink's employee, Charles E. Ostrout , acted as an accessory as he helped the group plan the robbery in advance by providing information on the truck driver's route.  Strout was eventually indicted, and sentenced to 5 years for racketeering.  Of the 12 perpetrators, Andrew Barnhill, Randolph Duey, James Dye, Randall Evans, Richard Kemp, Bruce Pierce, Gary Yarbrough, Robert Merki, Richard Scutari, Denver Parmenter were charged with armored car robbery and various other racketeering charges under the RICO Act.  It is unclear whether each of them was convicted for this particular incident, but overall, all ten of them were sentenced for their crimes with the Order after either trials or plea agreements, and received a range of prison sentences.  William Soderquist  walked free after he became a witness for the government and was placed in the witness protection program.

At the time of the explosion there was a crowd of approximately 60,000 people in the park attending a concert and festivities in celebration of the 1996 Olympic Games. One person was killed as a direct result of the explosion and 111 were injured, including six state troopers and one Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent. A cameraman suffered a heart attack and died while running toward the scene. A call to 911 from a nearby phone booth warned ""There is bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."" However, there were delays in communicating this message to authorities in the park, where the bomb was found about five minutes before it exploded. Analysts suspect that the call was intended to lure law enforcement officials to the park to injure them. Authorities initially and erroneously suspected that the person who found the bomb under a bench in the park and warned authorities about it was responsible for planting the device.

The vehicle was parked on 45th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.","05/01/2010: On Saturday evening at approximately 1830, in New York City, New York, United States of America, a t-shirt vendor located between 45th Street and Seventh and Eighth Avenues noticed a dark-colored Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) parked at the curb with its engine running and its hazard lights on. Officer Wayne Rhatigan, a member of the New York Police Department's mounted division, was alerted by the vendor and then approached the vehicle and looked inside, where he spotted a box that was smoking and was able to smell gunpowder. The NYPD Bomb Squad was called to the scene, where they deployed a robotic device to break the SUV's back windows and to observe what was inside the vehicle. In the vehicle, police discovered the following: three 20-gallon propane canisters; two five-gallon cans of gasoline; 40+ consumer-grade M-88 firecrackers that had been placed inside of a 20-ounce metal container that had been wrapped in duct tape; a 55-inch by 32-inch green metal locker that contained eight plastic bags that held a total of approximately 250 pounds of Urea based fertilizer, a metal pressure cooker pot containing wires and an additional 120 M-88 firecrackers. The vehicle, a dark blue 1993 Nissan Pathfinder with tinted windows, had license plates that were registered to a Ford pickup truck that had been taken to a junkyard near Bridgeport, Connecticut some time during the last half of April (license plate: 98C Y09). Additionally, the vehicle identification number (VIN) had been removed from the SUV. No casualties were reported and no group immediately claimed responsibility. However, on 05/02/2010, the Taliban posted a video on YouTube claiming responsibility for the event, saying that it was revenge for the killing of Baitullah Mehsur, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri.
